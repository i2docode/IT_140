* 3 stages of a git project:
	a. working directory - creating, editing deleting and orgnizing files.
		
	b. a staging area - where you'll list changes you make to the working
	directory.

	c. a repository - where git permanently stores those changes as different
	versions of the project.

0. create and edit target file.

1. git init - initializes/creates a new Git project.

2. git status - check status of changes made to files.
		- git sees the file but has not started tracking changes yet.


3. git add <file name(s)>; git status  - adds target files to the staging area.
					- check status of the project in git.


4. git diff - checks the differences between the working directory and the staging area.
		- git add <file name(s)> every time we make a change to a file.


5. git commit - after file changes are made to files (git add .)
		- run git commit -m 'commit message'


6. git log - log out the git commit history.
